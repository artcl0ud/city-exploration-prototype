Thank for your comments and talks, that help me to make Maestro better.

V2.89.3 - 2022-05-28

	Change tempo by script with MPTK_CurrentTempo = 120 (before, only MPTK_Speed was able to change the speed)
	New MVP example to show how integrate in a few lines of script a MIDI device (Maestro Pro) 

V2.89.2 - 2022-03-19
	Update MidiFilePlayer inspector: add filter on the popup MIDI list for selecting a MIDI.
	Update TestMidiStream: demo how to play MIDI events with the keyboard. 0-9: play notes, Arrow keys: change preset.
	Apply Sample Rate setting when loading SoundFont to be able to play Vorbis samples (Thank to Paul).
	Corrected MidiStreamPlayer which was not able to spatilize the sound (Unity Spatialization).
	Add exception detection on all callback (like OnEventNotesMidi) to help detecting error in your script.
	New design for MIDI and SoundFont setup windows. Now works fine with MacOS :-)

V2.89.1 - 2021-10-03
	Add helper link for the MidiFileLoader inspector and the related page on the web site.
	Add delayed start to MPTK_Play (Pro version)
	Add delayed stop to MPTK_Stop (Pro version)
	Add short script demo for MIDI looping
	Fix instanciation for all MPTK OnEventxxxx to avoid crash in rare cases.
	Fix Preset change for channel 9 are now enabled for MidiStreamPlayer
	Add new kind of demos: MVP (for Minimum Viable Product) has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product
	MVP Free: MidiLoop and TheSimplestMidiLoader
	MVP Pro: Spatializer3D for spatializing MIDI by tracks in a few lines of code

V2.89.0 - 2021-08-30
	Added OnMidiEvent can be used like a preprocessor of the MIDI events: it's possible to change the value of the MIDI events to modify in real time the song playing. [Pro]
	Added MPTK_TransExcludedChannel method useful to exclude a channel for transposing (in general, channel 9 for drums).
	Added MPTK_keepPlayingNonLooped properties: when set to true, NoteOff or Duration for non-looped samples are ignored and the samples play through to the end.
	Synth rate can be set to any value from the inspector or with MPTK_SynthRate.
	Output rate and buffer size can be modified when playing but only for test purpose.
	Added changing output rate and buffer size for iOS, but stay experimental.
	MPTK_ChannelPresetChange: apply bank and preset change even if not available but return false.
	MPTK_ChannelForcedPresetSet: apply bank and preset change even if not available but return false, able now to force bank.
	Added MPTK_RealTime properties: real time since the start of the MIDI.
	Added MPTK_KeepEndTrack properties: when set to true, meta MIDI event End Track are keep. Default is false.
	Added MPTK_TickLastNote properties: tick position for the last note-on found.
	Added MPTK_PositionLastNote properties: real time position in millisecond for the last note-on found in the MIDI.
	Added FootPrint capabilities: search a MIDI from a footprint and calculate a score tempo. [Pro]
	Added "Channel Exception" (MPTK_TransExcludedChannel) "Apply transpose on all channels except this one. -1 to apply all. Default is 9 because generally it's the drum channel and we don't want to transpose drum instruments!"
	Added "Real Time" (MPTK_RealTime) "Real time from the start of the playing. Tempo or speed change have no impact."
	Added "Keep MIDI EndTrack" (MPTK_KeepEndTrack) "When set to true, meta MIDI event End Track are keep and these MIDI events are taken into account for calculate the full duration of the MIDI."
	Added "Lean Synth Starting" (MPTK_LeanSynthStarting) "Sets the speed of the increase of the volume of the audio source when synth is starting."
	Added "Keep Playing Non Looped" (MPTK_KeepPlayingNonLooped) "When the option is on, non looped samples (drum samples for the most part) are play through to the end."
	Added "Release Time Modifier" (MPTK_ReleaseTimeMod) "Multiplier to increase or decrease the default release time defined in the SoundFont for each instrument."
	Added "Unity Audio Setting" (MPTK_AudioSettingFromUnity) "If checked then synth rate and buffer size will be automatically defined by Unity in accordance of the capacity of the hardware."
	Added "Synth Rate Free" (MPTK_EnableFreeSynthRate) "Allow free setting of the Synth Rate."
	Removed full errors stack logging because Unity do the job since version 2019!
	New site for hosting the API documentation https://mptkapi.paxstellar.com/annotated.html
	Fixed with SoundFont setup windows, no sample was removed when unselecting banks. 
	Fixed with SoundFont Effect, modified values in inspector was not saved when running.
	Fixed with Midi Synth, changing the bank was not taken into account until changing the preset.
	Fixed for MacOS, opening folders functions did'nt open the finder.
	Fixed for MacOS, now inspector can change synth output rate (experimental). 
	Fixed for iOS, now it's possible to change the Attack delay.
	Fixed for MPTK_ChannelForcedPresetSet, restore default preset from MIDI stream was wrong.
